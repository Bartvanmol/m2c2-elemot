# Eindelijk kan ik hier iets aanpassen
ik weet alleen niet hoe ik dit deed :-)
en nu ook nog eens proberen om foto's in te brengen

# Course objective
The aim of this course is to better steer and control electrical machines.
So far we can only switch the electric motor on and off. With a few tricks we can also adjust their speed. But this can only be done with great energy loss.
A frequency driver initially adjusts the drive frequency, giving the electric motor a different rotational speed.
But other properties can also be adjusted.
In these lab sessions we learn how to set up and use a motor controller.

The number of possible settings is innumerable. Not every possible setting is explained here. However, we give you the logic of programming a driver. To understand and use all parameters we refer to the control user guide.


# A word of thanks
It is mainly because of the technical support of Nidec Mechelen Belgium that we were able to make this course.
